# Purpose
Notifications are displayed on a Windows 10/11 screen every four hours (current setting), with a random note from the list, and a time-specific header for morning, afternoon, and evening. I originally wrote this for my girlfriend to display love notes (through notifications) on her computer throughout the day.


# Usage
Download dependencies
1. pip install -r requirements.txt 

# Customization and 
1. Can customize ICO (.ico) file, notification messages/headers, times range, and frequency of notification
2. I recommend creating a batch (.bat) file so that the script doesn't have to be run on terminal --> python main.py
